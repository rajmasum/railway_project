# Railway Commodity Reservation System

## Project Statement

Rail communication is an old-age and proven to be the safest mode of transportation. Further, Indian
railway is one of the largest railway network in India. We are aware that for the Indian railways, there
is a number of passenger reservation system known to the rail passengers and out of which the IRCTC
RPS is the most sophisticated one and the most popular among public. In parallel to public
transportation, Indian railways is also very much effective for commodity transportation. However,
Indian railways is yet to launch any reservation mechanism for commodity transportation. This project
is to take up this limitation and propose to develop a commodity reservation system
